# Emulate
This repository is my effort to learn different computational procedures by imitating good works.

Recently, I came across a learning concept called Shu-Ha-Ri. Shu-Ha-Ri is a Japanese concept that describes the stages of learning to mastery. "Shu" means to obey or protect, where a student follows the teachings and practices of a master closely. "Ha" means to detach or digress, where the student begins to branch out, experimenting and integrating their own understanding. Finally, "Ri" means to leave or transcend, where the student moves beyond traditional teachings, innovating and creating their own unique approach. This concept is often applied in martial arts, but it is also relevant in various fields like software development and agile methodologies.

Here, I will try to use this idea in learning and evolving computational methodologies I want to use in my research. First, I will try to emulate good work and write a post about how I did it.
